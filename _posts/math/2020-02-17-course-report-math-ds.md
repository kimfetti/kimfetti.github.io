I recently sat down with [Course Report][1] to discuss the math needed to become a data scientist.  Blending coding skills with mathematics lies at the heart of data science, so understanding fundamental math concepts is critical for a successful career within the field.  Linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics are the four math disciplines that fuel the bulk of data science.  In this interview, I discuss the role each topic plays in data science; I also work through an example problem from all four subjects.


Please continue to the [Course Report blog][2] for the full write-up and a link to the interview recording.
