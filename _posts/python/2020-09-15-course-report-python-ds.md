In a recent interview with [Course Report][1], I discussed the basics of Python and how Python is used for data science.  Python serves as an all-purpose programming language, so data scientists, engineers, analysts, and web developers alike utilize Python to build end-to-end projects, ready for launch into production.  Python also has incredibly simple syntax, which makes it a great first programming language for beginners.  We chat about these topics and many more in the video!

You can also check out a write up of our interview on the [Course Report blog][2].
