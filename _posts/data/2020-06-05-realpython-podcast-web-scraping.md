I recently sat down with Christopher Bailey at the Real Python Podcast to discuss web scraping as well as my [PyCon 2020 tutorial][1]: "It's Officially Legal so Let's Scrape the Web."  In this podcast we talk about web scraping tools and techniques, HTML basics and data cleaning, as well as a recent change to the legal landscape regarding scraping. 

Check out the YouTube video above or listen to the podcast at [Real Python][2].
