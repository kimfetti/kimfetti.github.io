Web scraping empowers you to write computer programs to collect data from websites automatically and recent legal rulings support your right to do so.  This tutorial covers the breadth and depth of web scraping: from HTML basics through pipeline methods to compile entire datasets.  My video provides step-by-step instructions on utilizing Python libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` as well as links to supplementary tutorial resources in the form of Google Colab or Jupyter notebooks.

Check out the supplementary materials via Google Colab ([Scraping Basics][1] and [Scraping Wikipedia][2]) or on [GitHub][3].
