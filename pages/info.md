With over a decade of experience, Kimberly specializes in data education, data visualization, and natural language processing. She has supported students in corporate settings, at academic universities, and most recently as director at a data science bootcamp. Kimberly has also worked in digital advertising agencies, helping clients understand their customers by leveraging unstructured data with modern NLP techniques. Kimberly's enthusiasm for teaching and blogging comes from her days as an academic.  She holds a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in math biology at the Ohio State University.  In her spare time -- who are we kidding? -- Kimberly has no spare time, but she always makes time for her family, friends, and her dog.
