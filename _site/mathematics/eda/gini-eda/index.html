<p>If you work with data long enough, you are bound to discover that calculating the average of a set of values rarely tells you the full data story.  As a simple example, each of the following groups of people have the same <strong>average pay</strong> of $100:</p>
<ul>
  <li>100 people who make $100 each</li>
  <li>50 people who make $150 each and 50 people who make $50</li>
  <li>1 person who makes $10,000 and 99 people who make nothing</li>
</ul>

<p>The primary difference is the way money is distributed among each of the 100 people.  Here, the spread of money  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion">statistical dispersion</a>.  Perhaps the most popular measurement of dispersion is standard deviation or variance.  Standard deviation roughly measures the distance between individual dataset values and the overall group mean. Standard deviation retains the same units as the quantity being measured, since we start with dollars in the previous example, standard deviation will also be reported in dollars.  But other unitless metrics can also be used to understand statistical dispersion.</p>

<p>One such measurement, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">the Gini coefficient</a> also known as the Gini index or Gini ratio, was published in 1912 by Italian statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini.  The historical use of this unitless measure of statistical dispersion has aimed at income or wealth distributions; in fact, despite being developed over 100 years ago, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31847943">the United Nations still uses the Gini coefficient in their annual ranking of nations</a> to understand wealth inequities. But the Gini coefficient can be used much more broadly to understand the dispersion of very diverse datasets.  After a more in depth exploration of the formula behind the Gini coefficient, let’s take a look at a few use cases that do not involve international economies thus demonstrating that the Gini coefficient can be added to your EDA process to strengthen your analyses.</p>

<p><span style="color:blue">Add something on a set where the standard deviation doesn’t cut it either</span></p>

<h2 id="defining-gini">Defining Gini</h2>

<p>To understand the Gini coefficient, let’s first discuss the Lorenz curve, a graph developed by Max Lorenz for visualizing income or wealth distribution.  The premise of the curve goes like this: take the incomes of a population and sort them from smallest to greatest.  Then visualize these incomes in a line plot where the \(x\)-values represent the percentage of people seen thus far and the \(y\)-values represent the cumulative proportion of wealth accumulated by this percentage of people.  For example, if the poorest 30% of the population holds 10% of a population’s wealth, the curve should pass through the scaled \(x,y\) coordinates (0.3, 0.1).  And note that if wealth were distributed evenly among all members of a population, the Lorenz curve would be a straight, 45-degree line where \(x=y\), where 30% of the people have 30% of the wealth, etc.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The Gini coefficient measures how much a population’s data deviates from perfectly even distribution. Assuming positive data values<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, the Gini coefficient ranges from zero to one, where</p>

<ul>
  <li>zero represents perfect equality (everyone has an equal amount) and</li>
  <li>one represents near perfect inequality (one person has all the money).</li>
</ul>

<p>For all situations in between, the Gini coefficient is thus calculated as the area enclosed between the Lorenz curve and the line of perfect equality, marked as \(A\) in the figure above, divided by the total triangular area, \(A + B\).</p>

<p>Returning to the examples discussed at the beginning of this post, each situation results in an average pay of $100 per person, but the Gini coefficient varies greatly for each scenario because Gini measures statistical dispersion.  Calculation of the Gini coefficient may prove useful for any problem or dataset where dispersion plays an important role. <span style="color:blue">(out at as a quote?)</span></p>

<p><img src="https://kimfetti.github.io/images/gini_compare.png" alt="Gini coefficient increases with wealth inequity." width="1000" /></p>

<h2 id="gini-in-python">Gini in Python</h2>

<p>To calculate the Gini coefficient in Python, one option is to integrate the area between the two curves numerically, using <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.quad.html">quadrature</a> from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">scipy</code> library for example.  Numerical integration may prove too slow or too complicated for applications at scale, however, so more straightforward implementations often begin from an alternative, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient#Definition">equivalent definition of the Gini coefficient</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Gini coefficient \(G\) is also defined as half of the data’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_difference#Relative_mean_absolute_difference">relative mean absolute difference</a>, which is a normalized form of the average absolute difference among all the pairs of observations in the dataset. 
\[ G = \frac{\sum\limits_i \sum\limits_j |x_i - x_j|}{2\sum\limits_i\sum\limits_j x_j}\]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As long as the data contains only positive, non-zero values, it is <a href="https://www.statsdirect.com/help/default.htm#nonparametric_methods/gini.htm">not necessary to compute all possible pairs</a>.  The calculation simplifies further by placing all values in ascending order and assigning an index \(i\), which ranges from 1 for the smallest value up to the size of the dataset \(n\) for the largest value.  The resulting formula for Gini
\[G = \frac{\sum\limits_i (2i - n - 1)x_i}{n\sum\limits_i x_i} \]
is equivalent and even speedier to compute with Python.</p>

<p>The best Python implementation I’ve found of this calculation comes from <a href="https://github.com/oliviaguest/gini/blob/master/gini.py">Olivia Guest</a>; subsequently, I will be using Olivia’s vectorized, <code class="highlighter-rouge">numpy</code> Gini function in the case studies that follow.</p>

<h2 id="case-1-baby-names">Case #1: Baby Names</h2>

<ul>
  <li><span style="color:blue">Why 1950? (All states officially states then.)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>So far I have provided examples of the Gini coefficient applied to its original field: economics.  Calculation of the Gini coefficient generalizes, however, to any dataset where statistical dispersion plays a critical role.  I will now illustrate two non-typical applications to demonstrate that calculation of the Gini coefficient could be added to improve the workflow of standard exploratory data analysis procedures.</p>

<p>The Social Security Administration of the United States <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html">hosts public records</a> of the first names given to babies registered with the SSA for researchers interested in naming trends.  When exploring this dataset for children born in 1950 or later, I discovered that 18 out of the top 20 most popular names were most commonly given to male children, so where were the female names?</p>

<center>
<img src="https://kimfetti.github.io/images/popular_names.png" alt="Most popular names given to US babies since 1950" width="500" />
</center>

<p>It is true that <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/03/30/396384911/why-are-more-baby-boys-born-than-girls">male births are slightly more likely</a> and more male babies have been registered with the SSA over the years – 53% male vs 47% female; nonetheless, I was still surprised to see such a larger proportion of male names in the popularity charts. After digging into the data further, I found that even though there are fewer females in the dataset, there have been consistently more unique female names each year.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://kimfetti.github.io/images/unique_names.png" alt="Number of unique names for male and female babies since 1950" width="700" />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Statistical dispersion appears to play a critical role in these data.  Putting back in financial terms, some male names contain a large amount of “wealth” – just consider the most popular name, Michael, which account for over 3% of all male children since 1950.   These ultra-popular names are likely passed down from generation to generation.  Females babies, however, are distributed more widely across a variety of names such that more names share in the “wealth” of female children.  We can verify that statistical dispersion differs between males and females by returning to the Gini coefficient.</p>

<p>Firstly, consider how the “wealth” of children is dispersed among each female name.  Some names in the dataset are given to only 5 registered babies<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> while other female names, like Jennifer, represent nearly 1.5 million individuals.  If we tally up all the females born with each name since 1950, we would find a huge disparity between the most and least popular names.  Following the same conventions presenting when defining Gini where we sort the names from least to most popular and then take the cumulative sum of females, we find the Gini coefficient for females to be 0.96 – very near perfect inequality!</p>

<center>
<img src="https://kimfetti.github.io/images/gini_females.png" alt="Gini coefficient for the popularity of female names " width="700" />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Male names exhibit a very similar Lorenz curve but slightly even more skewed, with a Gini coefficient of 0.97 when summing across all years since 1950.  This difference doesn’t seem like much, but consider an alternate view where instead of aggregating across time, the Gini coefficient is calculated for each gender based off of yearly naming trends.  Plotting both the female and male Gini coefficient values for each year since 1950 demonstrates a clear and persistent pattern where the male coefficient is consistently slightly higher than the female value, thus indicating more inequity and statistical dispersion among the male names.  Some male names are very popular while others simply are not.  Female babies, on the other hand, are not only given a greater variety of names at birth but they are also spread among the available names more equally which means no one name is ever immensely popular throughout the population.  Also note that both Gini values have ticked downward since the 1990s indicating a trending preference toward more diverse naming conventions, and the Gini values displayed in the figure below are lower than the aggregate Gini values because popular name tend to be popular year after year, thus bolstering naming inequity.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://kimfetti.github.io/images/gini_names.png" alt="The male Gini coefficient tracks consistently higher throughout time" width="700" />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>As one final look into Gini with this dataset, now consider Gini as a tool to determine if a name has exhibited consistent popularity across time.  Here we are zooming in on female babies, grouping by name, and then calculating the Gini coefficient for the babies born with each name over the years.  Names with lower Gini coefficients demonstrate similar levels of popularity through out the entire timespan (e.g. “Miriam” below with about 1K babies each year) while a higher Gini indicates that name has seen uneven popularity over time (e.g. the sharp increase in babies named “Scarlett” below beginning at the turn of the millennium).  <span style="color:blue">Mention that both names had about 60K female babies over the course of time.  More explanation on this: for each name, least to most popular years lined up and cumulative sum applied </span></p>

<h2 id="case-2-healthcare-prices">Case #2: Healthcare Prices</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Different procedures have different distributions – need regulation or more transparency?</li>
</ul>

<p>For this second example, consider <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Inpatient2017">this 2017 dataset</a> hosted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency of the United States.  These data, aggregated as procedural averages across hospitals, include the billing charges and eventual payments for over 500 separate inpatient procedures and diagnoses for Medicare patients.  I applied Gini coefficient calculations to determine which, if any, procedures require better billing standardization with the underlying basis for this analysis that the higher the Gini coefficient, the greater the disparity among what hospitals charges on average for a given procedure.</p>

<p>The diagnosis exhibiting the highest Gini coefficient among average hospital charges in this dataset<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> is labeled as, “Alcohol/Drug Abuse or Dependency w Rehabilitation Therapy.”  This is perhaps unsurprising given that rehabilitation therapies vary widely both in terms of treatment length and illness severity.  In fact, all other procedures and diagnoses with the top five highest Gini coefficients, such as coagulation disorders and psychoses, can also vary in severity.  Procedures that show the most uniformity in terms of hospital charges, on the other hand, typically describe one-time cardiac events such as value replacement, percutaneous surgeries, or observation for chest pain.</p>

</center>

<p>So what about billing regulation?  Do we need more safeguards in place to be sure hospitals are charging similar amounts for similar procedures?  Well, more transparency certainly wouldn’t hurt when estimating realistic costs, especially for treatments that vary in duration or intensity, but let’s return back to the original dataset.  Information is provided for both the amount charged by the hospitals, which has been analyzed thus far, as well as <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Downloads/Inpatient_Outpatient_FAQ.pdf">the total payments the hospitals actually received for the procedures</a>.  The data exhibit much lower Gini coefficients when applying procedural Gini calculations to the total payments instead.  In fact, the Gini coefficient is lower for the total payments than the hospital charges, for <em>every single procedure</em>.  This fancinating insight indicates that the contracts Medicare has in place with US hospitals really are already doing a lot to moderate and regularize procedural costs.</p>
