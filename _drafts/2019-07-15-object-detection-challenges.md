The field of computer vision has experience substantial progress recently owing largely to advances in deep learning, specifically convolutional neural nets (CNNs).  Image classification, where a computer classifies or assigns labels to an image based on its content, can often see great results simply by leveraging pre-trained neural nets and fine-tuning the last few throughput layers.  

Classifying _and_ finding individual objects within an image, however, was considered an extremely difficult problem only a few years ago.  This task, called object detection, is now feasible and has even been productized by companies like [Google][1] and [IBM][2]. But all of this progress wasn't easy!  Object detection presents many substantial challenges beyond what is required for image classification.  After further introducing the topic, let's take a deep dive into several of the interesting obstacles object detection problems raise along with methods researchers have proposed as resulting solutions.


## Introduction
- What is object detection?  Leads to video tracking
- Applications
- History
    - Manual feature collection
    - Major gains once CNN applied to problem
    - Image depicting methods on a timeline (+ challenges overcome by each that can be referenced later)

## Challenges

### 1. Dual priorities: object localization and classification

The first major complication of object detection is its added goal: not only do we want to classify an image's objects but also to determine the objects' positions, generally referred to as the _object localization_ task in literature.  Researchers often take one of two approaches to address this issue: 1) pipelines with region proposals or 2) one-shot regression methods with a multi-task loss function.

a. Pipeline methods with region proposals

b. One-shot regression with multi-task loss function

#### Metrics
Another interesting consequence of having multiple objectives is the need for special metrics to score object detection methods.  Two such metrics, IOU and mAP, are common among the object detection community and are typically reported when comparing techniques.

a. IOU 

IOU stands for intersection over union and is used to judge appropriate object localization.

b. mAP 

mAP, or mean average precision, on the other hand, assesses the classification task.

- Regions of interest (independent of class, pipeline solution)
- Multi-task loss function
- Multiple objects in one image
- New metrics: IOU


### 2. Objects have multiple spatial scales and aspect ratios
- Warping of ROI before being fed into CNN (R-CNN)
- SPP layer
- Anchors


### 3. Spatial position IS relevant 
- Image classification does not do this
- Fully connected layers (slow)
- ?? (I forgot this solution... )


### 4. Speed
- Heading toward RT detection in videos -- need to process images very quickly
- Fast R-CNN (process image through CNN first)
- Faster R-CNN (separate RPN)
- YOLO (multi-task optimization, all in one go, no alternate optimization like Faster R-CNN)
- SSD?
- Truncated SVD
- Trade speed and accuracy

### 5. Data
- Lots of data for image classification (ImageNet), not so much for image detection (COCO)
- YOLO9000 attempt to leverage both for training

## Conclusion
- Much harder than image classification tasks
- Future challenges like adding LSTM, time component to video processing.  Currently one frame at a time
- Marry speed and accuracy AND extend object class space
- Also: pose, occlusions, lighting (same issues that image classification has but maybe even more so since also trying to localize object)
