If you work with data long enough, you are bound to discover that a dataset's mean rarely--if ever--tells you the full data story.  As a simple example, each of the following groups of people have the same **average pay** of $100:
- 100 people who make $100 each
- 50 people who make $150 each and 50 people who make $50
- 1 person who makes $10,000 and 99 people who make nothing

The primary difference, of course, is the way that money is distributed among each of the 100 people.  The spread of money in this case represents [statistical dispersion][1].  Perhaps the most popular measurement of statistical dispersion is standard deviation or variance; however, you can leverage other metrics, such as the Gini coefficient, to obtain a new perspective on your data's spread.

<!--  Standard deviation roughly measures the distance between individual dataset values and the overall group mean. Standard deviation retains the same units as the quantity being measured, since we start with dollars in the previous example, standard deviation will also be reported in dollars.  But other unitless metrics can also be used to understand statistical dispersion.  -->

[The Gini coefficient][2], also known as the Gini index or the Gini ratio, was introduced in 1912 by Italian statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini.  Analysts have historically used this value to study income or wealth distributions; in fact, despite being developed over 100 years ago, [the United Nations still uses the Gini coefficient][3] in their annual ranking of nations to understand monetary inequities. But the Gini coefficient may be utilized much more broadly! After a more thorough mathematical explanation, let's apply the Gini coefficient to a few non-standard use cases that do not involving international economies.

<!-- thus demonstrating that the Gini coefficient can be added to your EDA process to strengthen your analyses. -->

## Defining Gini

The first step in understanding the Gini coefficient requires a discussion on the Lorenz curve, a graph developed by Max Lorenz for visualizing income or wealth distribution.  To trace out the Lorenz curve, begin by taking the incomes of a population and sorting them from smallest to largest.  Then build a line plot where the \\(x\\)-values represent the percentage of people seen thus far and the \\(y\\)-values represent the cumulative proportion of wealth attributed to this percentage of people.  For example, if the poorest 30% of the population holds 10% of a population's wealth, the curve should pass through the scaled \\(x,y\\) coordinates (0.3, 0.1).  Note also that if wealth was distributed evenly among all members of a population, the Lorenz curve would follow a straight line, \\(x=y\\).  See the figure below for an illustration of a hypothetical Lorenz curve along with the line of equality.

<br>

The Gini coefficient measures how much a population's Lorenz curve from perfect equality or how much a set of data diverges from an even distribution.  The Gini coefficient typically ranges from zero to one[^1], where

- zero represents perfect equality _(everyone has an equal amount)_ and 
- one represents near perfect inequality _(one person has all the money)_.  

For all situations in between, the Gini coefficient \\(G\\) equals
\\[G = \frac{A}{A + B}\\]
where \\(A\\) signifies the region enclosed between the line of perfect equality and the Lorenz curve, as indicated in the figure above, while \\(A + B\\) represents the total triangular area.

[^1]: The Gini coefficient is strictly non-negative, \\(G \geq 0\\), as long as the mean of the data is assumed positive.  Gini can theoretically be greater than one if some data values are negative, which occurs in the context of wealth if some people contribute to the population's wealth negatively in the form of debts owed.

Each of the three situations discussed in the introduction produce an average of $100 per person, but the Gini coefficient varies greatly for each scenario since Gini measures statistical dispersion.  As seen in the figure below, calculation of the Gini coefficient may prove valuable for any problem or dataset where dispersion plays an important role.

## Gini in Python

To calculate a dataset's Gini coefficient with Python, you have the option of quantifying the shaded area \\(A\\) with something like `scipy`'s [quadrature][4] routine.  If this style of numerical integration proves slow or too complicated for applications at scale, other implementations often begin from an alternative, [equivalent definition of the Gini coefficient][5].
> The Gini coefficient may also be expressed as half of the data's [relative mean absolute difference][6], a normalized form of the average absolute difference among all pairs of observations in the dataset. 
\\[ G = \frac{\sum\limits_i \sum\limits_j |x_i - x_j|}{2\sum\limits_i\sum\limits_j x_j}\\]

The calculation simplifies further if the data consists of only positive values as it becomes [unnecessary to evaluate all possible pairs][7].  Sorting the datapoints in ascending order and assigning a positional index \\(i\\) yields
\\[G = \frac{\sum\limits_i (2i - n - 1)x_i}{n\sum\limits_i x_i}, \\]
which is even speedier to compute. 

The best Python implementation of the Gini coefficient that I've found comes from [Olivia Guest][8]. I will subsequently leverage her vectorized `numpy` function to calculate Gini in the case studies that follow.


## Case \#1: Baby Names

So far we have mostly addressed the Gini coefficient in the context of its original field of economics.  This metric generalizes, however, to provide insight whenever statistical dispersion plays a critical role.  I will now illustrate two atypical applications to demonstrate that use of the Gini coefficient could help improve the workflow of exploratory data analysis procedures.

The Social Security Administration of the United States (SSA) [hosts public records][9] on the names given to US babies for research purposes.  Aggregating these data for children born since 1950, I discovered that 18 out of the top 20 most popular names more commonly associate with male children.  So where are the females?  

<center>
<img src="{{ site.urlimg }}popular_names.png" alt="Most popular names given to US babies since 1950" width = "500">
</center> 

Slighly [more male births are born each year][10] and certainly more male babies have been registered with the SSA (53% male vs 47% female); nonetheless, I was still surprised to see such a large proportion of male names in my quick popularity chart. Digging into the data further, I found that even though fewer females appear in the data, there have been consistently more unique female names each year.  

<center>
<img src="{{ site.urlimg }}unique_names.png" alt="Number of unique names for male and female babies since 1950" width = "700">
</center> 
<br>

Statistical dispersion appears to play a significant role in these data.  To put it back in financial terms, some male names like the ones on my top 20 list are just extremely "wealthy." (The most popular name, Michael, accounts for over 3% of all male children born since 1950.)   These ultra-popular masculine names likely pass down from generation to generation.  Females babies, on the other hand, are distributed more widely across a variety of names, so more names share in the "wealth" of female children.  We can verify this theory by returning to the Gini coefficient.

<! -- here -->
Firstly, consider how the "wealth" of children is dispersed among each female name.  Some names in the dataset are given to only 5 registered babies[^2] while other female names, like Jennifer, represent nearly 1.5 million individuals.  If we tally up all the females born with each name since 1950, we would find a huge disparity between the most and least popular names.  Following the same conventions presenting when defining Gini where we sort the names from least to most popular and then take the cumulative sum of females, we find the Gini coefficient for females to be 0.96 -- very near perfect inequality!

[^2]: The Social Security Administration does not include names that are less popular than 5 babies per gender per state due to privacy reasons.  Five children for one given female name is the absolution minimum allowed by this regulation.

<img src="{{ site.urlimg }}gini_females.png" alt="Gini coefficient for the popularity of female names " width = "700">
</center> 
<br>

Male names exhibit a very similar Lorenz curve but slightly even more skewed, with a Gini coefficient of 0.97 when summing across all years since 1950.  This difference doesn't seem like much, but consider an alternate view where instead of aggregating across time, the Gini coefficient is calculated for each gender based off of yearly naming trends.  Plotting both the female and male Gini coefficient values for each year since 1950 demonstrates a clear and persistent pattern where the male coefficient is consistently slightly higher than the female value, thus indicating more inequity and statistical dispersion among the male names.  Some male names are very popular while others simply are not.  Female babies, on the other hand, are not only given a greater variety of names at birth but they are also spread among the available names more equally which means no one name is ever immensely popular throughout the population.  Also note that both Gini values have ticked downward since the 1990s indicating a trending preference toward more diverse naming conventions, and the Gini values displayed in the figure below are lower than the aggregate Gini values because popular name tend to be popular year after year, thus bolstering naming inequity.

<br>

As one final look into Gini with this dataset, now consider Gini as a tool to determine if a name has exhibited consistent popularity across time.  Here we are zooming in on female babies, grouping by name, and then calculating the Gini coefficient for the babies born with each name over the years.  Names with lower Gini coefficients demonstrate similar levels of popularity through out the entire timespan (e.g. "Miriam" below with about 1K babies each year) while a higher Gini indicates that name has seen uneven popularity over time (e.g. the sharp increase in babies named "Scarlett" below beginning at the turn of the millennium).  <span style="color:blue">Mention that both names had about 60K female babies over the course of time.

## Case \#2: Healthcare Prices

For this second example, consider [this 2017 dataset][11] hosted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency of the United States.  These data, aggregated as procedural averages across hospitals, include the billing charges and eventual payments for over 500 separate inpatient procedures and diagnoses for Medicare patients.  I applied Gini coefficient calculations to determine which, if any, procedures require better billing standardization with the underlying basis for this analysis that the higher the Gini coefficient, the greater the disparity among what hospitals charges on average for a given procedure.

The diagnosis exhibiting the highest Gini coefficient among average hospital charges in this dataset[^3] is labeled as, "Alcohol/Drug Abuse or Dependency w Rehabilitation Therapy."  This is perhaps unsurprising given that rehabilitation therapies vary widely both in terms of treatment length and illness severity.  In fact, all other procedures and diagnoses with the top five highest Gini coefficients, such as coagulation disorders and psychoses, can also vary in severity.  Procedures that show the most uniformity in terms of hospital charges, on the other hand, typically describe one-time cardiac events such as value replacement, percutaneous surgeries, or observation for chest pain.

[^3]: Some diagnosis related groups (DRGs) in this dataset occur at as few as one hospital for the entire year.  I have filtered the dataset down to procedures that are documented by at least 50 hospitals to avoid high variance issues.

</center>

So what about billing regulation?  Do we need more safeguards in place to be sure hospitals are charging similar amounts for similar procedures?  Well, more transparency certainly wouldn't hurt when estimating realistic costs, especially for treatments that vary in duration or intensity, but let's return back to the original dataset.  Information is provided for both the amount charged by the hospitals, which has been analyzed thus far, as well as [the total payments the hospitals actually received for the procedures][12].  The data exhibit much lower Gini coefficients when applying procedural Gini calculations to the total payments instead.  In fact, the Gini coefficient is lower for the total payments than the hospital charges, for *every single procedure*.  This fancinating insight indicates that the contracts Medicare has in place with US hospitals really are already doing a lot to moderate and regularize procedural costs.

The Gini coefficient continues to supply insight over 100 years after its inception.  As a good, general-purpose measure of statistical dispersion, its use should not merely be confined to economic description but can be used much more broadly to explore and understand data from nearly any discipline.  The most popular metric for understanding data spread today is undoubtly standard deviation; however, there are [several key differences][13] between standard deviation and the Gini coefficient, which means you will need to consider your desired use before choosing between these summary statistics.  Firstly, standard deviation retains the units of the data it is applied to --  taking the standard deviation US incomes yields a value in dollars; whereas, the Gini coefficient is scale invariant. Secondly, standard deviation is also unbounded meaning it can take on any non-negative value, but Gini is capped between zero and one.  Because of Gini's scale invariance and strict bounds, comparing statistical dispersion between two dissimilar data sources becomes much easier.  One final difference is how Gini and standard deviation judge statistical dispersion.  For a given dataset, Gini reaches its maximum value if one datapoint is positive and all other points are zero.  Standard deviation reaches its maximum if half the values are at the extreme maximum while the other half of the values are at the extreme minimum.

Despite the many benefits of incorporating the Gini coefficient into your EDA process, [limitations also exist][14] and should be recognized.  Gini is many-to-one in that many different data distributions result in the same coefficient value.  In this way, Gini loses information from the original dataset, but it is a summary statistic after all so this information loss is to be expected.  The Gini coefficient can also be quite sensitive to outliers, a singular extreme datapoint at either end of the spectrum may increase Gini dramatically.  On the other hand, the Gini coefficient has [also been criticized in the realm of economics for being undersensitive to changes in the upper and lower echelons of wealth][3].  Economist have even gone so far as introducing separate metrics, such as the Palma ratio, to explicitly capture changes in wealth of the richest 10% and the poorest 40% of a population.

No matter which metric for statistical dispersion you choose, building data intuition certainly goes beyond simply looking at the mean or median.  The Gini coefficient, long since popular in the field of economics, might just be the missing piece of your EDA toolkit. Gini can be tracked over time, calculated on segments of data, and may even provide you with a critical piece of information in order to understand not just the what by the why behind your data.
