Content for "abstract" including
- What is statistical dispersion?
- Metric developed by Gini
- UN uses it for ranking countries: wealth vs. income inequality
- I suggest expanding its use to be part of your EDA (measures overall statistical dispersion, yo!)


## Defining Gini
- Typical definition involving Lorenz curve
- Main idea: Area shrinks as curve pulls away from straight line
- Include approximation via Pareto principle?  (Or save for final takeaways?)

## Python 

- Libraries available
- Mathy definitions


## Baby Names Example

- Dataset
- Top names are all males which leads to theory of different statistical dispersion
- Measure Gini across time

## Healthcare Price Example

- Different procedures have different distributions -- need regulation or more transparency?

## Conclusion

- Recap of findings
- Pros and Cons of Gini
- Metric is lossy: exmaples of two distributions that have the same Gini values
- As with any metric, next step is WHY?  (Gini for nation's inequality can miss aging population, government assistance, etc.) 
Domain knowledge is critical!
